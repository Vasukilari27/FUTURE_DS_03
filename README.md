# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis – Task 3

This repository contains my submission for **Task 3** of the **Future Interns - Data Science & Analytics Internship**.  
The goal of this task was to analyze textual and numerical feedback collected from college events using data science techniques, particularly **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

College events such as tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities collect feedback — but are we using it meaningfully?

In this project, I analyzed student feedback (ratings and comments) using Python-based tools to understand satisfaction levels and suggest improvements for future events.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare CSV feedback data  
- Analyze satisfaction ratings (1–5 scale)  
- Perform sentiment analysis using **TextBlob**  
- Visualize trends using **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **WordCloud**  
- Provide actionable suggestions to enhance future college events
